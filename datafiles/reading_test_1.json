			"question": "Read the paragraph from a narrative about a hike \n\nKim had hiked this mountain so many times. She loved the challenges of the trail, the gnarly roots that threatened to trip her, and the embedded stones worn smooth by years of foot traffic. Her brother, Ned, had leapt ahead of her on the trail like a mountain goat. He had probably already arrived at Alpine Lake, the glistening, unspoiled expanse of brilliant blue that was their destination. As she emerged from the shaded trail for her first glimpse of the lake, she paused to take in its splendor. \n\nChoose the sentence which, if added to the paragraph, would BEST create suspense.",
			"graphic": "noone",
			"answers": [
				"The lake settled into the landscape like a brilliant blue bowl, encircled by the emerald forest, presenting a striking \n contrast of intense color.",
				"Then, behind her, she heard the light thud of footsteps and the whisper of branches brushing against something, \n something mobile, and she shivered in the warm sunlight.",
				"Once, a real estate developer had threatened to create a small resort community on the shores of the lake, but he had met \n with so much resistance that he gave up the plan.",
				"She heard Ned calling for her somewhere along the shore, and she realized that he was waiting impatiently for her to join him."

			"answer": "Then, behind her, she heard the light thud of footsteps and the whisper of branches brushing against something, \n something mobile, and she shivered in the warm sunlight."

			"question": "A student is conducting research for a report about the county where she lives. Read her online source and the directions that follow. \nSource: statehandbook/burlesoncounty/geography/online \n\nBurleson County consists of 423 square miles of gently sloping and level terrain with elevations ranging from 4260 feet in the southeast to 4890 feet in the northwest. The La Salle River is the one major watercourse and flows from the northwest to the southeast with tributaries draining both the western and eastern half of the county. Two natural geographic regions dominate the county: the smaller, Redland Prairie region in the southeast is redominately rolling grassland with soil of mostly shallow clay. The Timber Breaks region contains an abundance of deep loamy soil that supports hardwoods such as American elm and box elder. 84% of Burleson County is considered prime farmland. \n\nThe student wrote the following paragraph for her report. Select the sentence that requires revision to avoid plagiarizing the online source.",
			"graphic": "noone",
			"answers": [
				"Burleson County is one of the fastest growing areas in the state, particularly the southeast portion of the county.",
				"New apartments and single-family homes are being built in the Redland Prairie area, where 60 acres of rolling grassland \n have been set aside for a regional high school.",
				"One of the significant effects of this development will be increased recreational traffic in the two county parks along the river.",
				"The La Salle River is the one major watercourse and flows to the southeast with tributaries draining the county."

			"question": "A student is writing an informative report about a hiking trip. Read the draft and complete the task that follows. \n\nThree trails are clearly marked through Arrowhead Canyon. The Lower Trail is an easy, two-hour loop along the creek bed. Most of the trail is hard-packed earth, level and wide enough for three hikers-or any trio out for a stroll-to walk side by side. There are even a few park benches along the way. The Middle Trail is more challenging. In several places, hikers need to scramble over fallen timber or rugged rock outcroppings. The path up to and around the waterfall can be a little treacherous, but with a little determination and a sturdy pair of shoes, kids as young as eight or nine can hike to Mason Falls and back within four or five hours. I'm completely amazed by the Upper Trail. That hike requires a little more preparation and no less than 18 hours. \n\nWhich revision of the underlined sentence BEST maintains the tone and focus of the paragraph?",
			"graphic": "noone",
			"answers": [
				"The Upper Trail is an entirely different challenge.",
				"You have to see the Upper trail to believe it.",
				"The Upper Trail is too amazing to imagine.",
				"You must indeed travel the Upper Trail."
			],
			"answer": "The Upper Trail is an entirely different challenge."
